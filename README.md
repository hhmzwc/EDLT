The code is for paper "EDLT: Enabling Deep Learning for Generic Data
Classification". If you use this code, please cite this paper as follows:Huimei Han, Xingquan Zhu, Ying Li, "EDLT: Enabling Deep Learning for Generic Data", ICDM 2018.

First run the python code :step1-generic_correlation_matrix and_vector   to obtain  feature-feature and feature-label correlation
Then run the matlab code:mainstep2    to obtain the feature_reordering matrix for 2*2 filter
Finally  run  the python code: step3-train  to obtain the CNN classification accuracy
